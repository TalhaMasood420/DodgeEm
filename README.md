# Introduction
Welcome to my version of Dodge Em game! This classic arcade-style game is my personal take on the popular Atari game of the same name. I created this game using C++ programming language, as well as the Glut and Glew libraries for graphics and window management.

The objective of the game is to navigate your car through a field of moving obstacles while avoiding collisions. The gameplay is fast-paced and challenging, with increasing difficulty levels as you progress through the game.

Please refer to the rest of this README.md file for instructions on how to install and play the game.

# Development
### Dependencies

 - C++ Compiler
 - Glut
 - Glew

### Installation
On Ubuntu, you can install these dependencies with the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get install g++ freeglut3-dev glew-utils libglew-dev libfreeimage-dev
```

On macOS, you can install these dependencies with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install gcc freeglut glew
```

### Run Game
Run the below two commands two start the game
```shell
make
./game
```

# Controls
To play the game, you will need to use the following controls:

-   `Up Arrow`: Move your car upwards
-   `Down Arrow`: Move your car downwards
-   `Left Arrow`: Move your car to the left
-   `Right Arrow`: Move your car to the right
-   `Space`: Activate turbo boost

For multi-player mode:
-   `W`: Move your car upwards
-   `S`: Move your car downwards
-   `A`: Move your car to the left
-   `D`: Move your car to the right

The controls are fairly simple and intuitive, and allow you to move your car in any direction to avoid the obstacle car. The turbo boost can be especially useful when trying to avoid obstacle car.

# Gameplay
### Single Player Mode
In Single Player mode, the objective is to navigate your car through a field of moving obstacle cars while avoiding collisions. You will also need to collect all the points on the screen to proceed to the next level. There are four levels in total, each with increasing difficulty. If you can complete all four levels, you win the game!

### Multi Player Mode
In Multiplayer mode, two players can play simultaneously on the same screen. One player uses the arrow keys to control their car, while the other player uses the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys. The objective is the same as in Single Player mode: avoid obstacle cars and collect as many points as possible. The player who collects the most points at the end of the round wins!

Overall, the gameplay is designed to be challenging and engaging, with different modes to suit your preferences. Whether you're playing alone or with a friend, you'll need to stay alert and focused if you want to succeed in this fast-paced game. Good luck!
